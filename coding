Coding standards
----------------
- Use comments. Not too many, but more than one line is certainly 
allowed. This module could become a sort of 'learning' module for other 
develpers, including some advanced functions like OnUninstall.
- Code is beautified by beautify_php from time to time. This *can* break 
code (unfortunately). If anyone knows a (better) alternative, please let 
me know.
- Try not to include HTML code inside PHP scripts, or almost none.
- Debug echo's, print_r's and whatsoever should be *removed* in release 
versions, not only commented out.
- ALWAYS test data integrity, quote all database fields and values in SQL queries
- Use XOOPS Core API where possible, deprecated functions should be avoided if possible
- ALWAYS cvs update before cvs commit
